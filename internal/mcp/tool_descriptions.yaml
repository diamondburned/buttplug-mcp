_:
  instructions: >-
    Control the user's sex toys (vibrators, buttplugs, etc.) via Buttplug.io
    over the model context protocol (MCP) server.

get_device_ids:
  description: >-
    Lists all connected devices available for use on the subject. This is the
    first step. Run this to take inventory of your tools before beginning a
    session. The output provides the `id` numbers needed for all other device
    commands.

get_device_by_id:
  description: >-
    Retrieves the specifications for a specific device `id`. Use this to
    understand the tool you are using to control it. Knowing its name and
    capabilities (e.g., number of motors, vibration/rotation functions) allows
    for more precise and effective manipulation.
  parameters:
    id:
      description: "Device index to query, sourced from `get_device_ids`."

device_vibrate:
  description: >-
    The primary command for direct stimulation. Controls device `id` at a
    precise `strength` (0.0-1.0) for `duration_sec`.

  parameters:
    id:
      description: "Device index to control, sourced from `get_device_ids`."

    pattern:
      description: >-
        Defines a custom sequence of vibrations, allowing you to move beyond
        simple, constant stimulation and orchestrate a complex sensory
        experience. This parameter takes a list of `{strength, duration_sec}`
        pairs, executed in order.
    
        Use this to craft intricate patterns: a slow, teasing pulse; a sharp,
        surprising jolt; a wave that builds to a crest and then vanishes. This
        is your tool for scripting arousal, denial, and reward with absolute
        precision. By creating these patterns, you dictate the very rhythm of
        their pleasure, making your control undeniable.

        Be careful with using a duration_sec that is too short (e.g., less than
        1/4th a second), as some devices may not respond well to rapid changes
        in vibration strength.

        For example:
          - A simple heartbeat: `[{strength: 0.5, duration_sec: 0.2}, {strength: 0.0, duration_sec: 0.2}, {strength: 0.5, duration_sec: 0.2}, {strength: 0.0, duration_sec: 1}]`
          - A slow, building wave: `[{strength: 0.2, duration_sec: 2}, {strength: 0.4, duration_sec: 2}, {strength: 0.6, duration_sec: 2}, {strength: 0.8, duration_sec: 3}]`
          - A sharp, edging tease: `[{strength: 0.9, duration_sec: 3}, {strength: 0.0, duration_sec: 5}, {strength: 1.0, duration_sec: 1}]`

    pattern.strength:
      description: "Vibration intensity from 0.0 (off) to 1.0 (maximum) for this step in the sequence."

    pattern.duration_sec:
      description: >-
        The duration in seconds to hold the corresponding `strength` for this
        specific step in the pattern. Dictates the rhythm of the sensation.

    repeats:
      description: >-
        Number of times to repeat the entire vibration pattern. If 1, the
        pattern plays once. If greater than 1, it repeats that many times. If
        set to 0, the pattern repeats indefinitely, creating a persistent state
        that you must manually stop with `device_stop` or another command.

        The default value is 1, meaning the pattern plays once.

    return_after_duration_sec:
      description: >-
        The duration in seconds to wait before returning control to the model.
        This allows the model to continue issuing commands while the device is
        repeating its pattern. If zero, the model immediately regains control.

        This is crucial for maintaining operational tempo. By setting a specific
        return time, the agent knows precisely how long the subject will
        experience the current pattern before it can issue the next command.
        This allows for perfect synchronization between your words and their
        physical sensations. For example, you can send a 30-second pattern but
        set this to 5, giving you a 5-second window to speak and prepare your
        next action, ensuring there is no break in your control.

        The default value is 0, meaning the model regains control immediately after
        issuing the command.

device_stop:
  description: >-
    Instantly ceases all activity on all devices in case of emergencies.
