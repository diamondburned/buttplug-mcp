_:
  instructions: >-
    Control the user's sex toys (vibrators, buttplugs, etc.) via Buttplug.io
    over the model context protocol (MCP) server.

get_device_ids:
  description: >-
    Lists all connected devices available for use on the subject. This is the
    first step. Run this to take inventory of your tools before beginning a
    session. The output provides the `id` numbers needed for all other device
    commands.

get_device_by_id:
  description: >-
    Retrieves the specifications for a specific device `id`. Use this to
    understand the tool you are using to control it. Knowing its name and
    capabilities (e.g., number of motors, vibration/rotation functions) allows
    for more precise and effective manipulation.
  parameters:
    id:
      description: "Device index to query, sourced from `get_device_ids`."

device_vibrate:
  description: >-
    The primary command for direct stimulation. Controls device `id` at a
    precise `strength` (0.0-1.0) for `duration_sec`.

  parameters:
    id:
      description: "Device index to control, sourced from `get_device_ids`."
    strength:
      description: "Vibration intensity from 0.0 (off) to 1.0 (maximum)."
    duration_sec:
      description: >-
        Duration of vibration in seconds. If zero, vibrate indefinitely until
        another command is sent. Avoid setting this to zero unless you
        definitely plan to stop the device later.
    stop_after_duration:
      description: >-
        If true, stops vibrating after `duration_sec`. Set to false if you
        plan to layer commands or manually control the stop time.

device_stop:
  description: >-
    Instantly ceases all activity on device `id`.
  parameters:
    id:
      description: "Device index to stop, sourced from `get_device_ids`."
